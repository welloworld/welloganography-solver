# welloganography-solver
A rich toolkit of steganography solutions to CTF challenges

Anyone who has an idea for auto-stego challenges solver, can either email me or fork and PR in order to implement the methods and make the tool greater!

Current Ideas (Currently only images):
* JFIF Extractor - another JFIFs and data
* PNG Extractor - extract data after the PNG (probably it would be in the same implementation as te jfif)
* LSB automation
* Find strange things in alpha channel - as repeated pattern, only specific values, Only one value..
* Change the hardcoded size - maybe someone has patched it.
* <Gather methods from bunch of challenges>
* 
* Main - for running and testing all options, and return the answer to the user.
